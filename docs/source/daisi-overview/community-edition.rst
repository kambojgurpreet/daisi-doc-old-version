==============================

By default, a newly created daisi is private to its owner who is the only one able to see it and call it.   

The visibility settings can be adjusted in the **Settings** tab of the daisi.   

A daisi can be :   

#. Made visible inside a team
#. Made public, meaning that everyone can visualize it and execute it anonymously
